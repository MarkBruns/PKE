## **Phase I: Foundations and Environment Setup (Days 1-20)**

Phase I is dedicated to constructing a robust "mission control" for the entire 100-day project. The first week focuses on creating the digital skeleton of the project. Modules 001 and 002 are about the GitHub Repository and Project Initialization.

To accelerate the setup of the PKM's note-taking structure on Day 2, the project will incorporate [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), as we use the Foam VS Code extension and add basic starter templates. The [**Foam** development Foam community [on Discord]](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g) is all about rapid development of this personal knowledge management and sharing system, originally inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built as an extension of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that utilizes [GitHub](https://github.com/) features. Our implementation of **Foam** is very lightweight and thus will reside within this PKM repository which also stores the mdBook markdown files; thus, PKM's **Foam** will be used as an editing tool for meta-organizing our research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, eventually, publishing the content to the web utilizing the [https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM mdBook project structure](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM) we set up on Day 1 of [Phase I](/1.md). 

It is probably worth reiterating or re-emphasizing WHY the [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) for personal knowledge management is such a big deal ... besides being inspired by [some really solid ideas from the cognitive side of notetaking that Roam Research is famous for](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6). Of course, **Foam** would be powerful enough as a standalone app, to compete with things like Notion, Evernote, Obsidian or even Roam, but as a VSCode extension, [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) eliminates context-switching for devs who are already using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) in their dev work, making it easier to build personal MarkDown wikis [as well as things like mdBooks] which are basically the simplest form of plain text that allows for basic formating, with *.md files right in code repositories, as one works alongside the *.md files with text code files such as Python *.py, Javascript *.js or Rust *.rs, enhancing efficiency in tech-heavy careers.

The example of this paragraph is included, self-referentially, to illustrate how a **Foam** [[wiki-links]] MarkDown note is [not] rendered in HTML by mdBook. As one might imagine, there are a lot of features on the **Foam** [[roadmap]] that don't exist yet or need a fair amount of work, even though the **Foam** [[principles]] are fairly well-developed and very intuitive. The material in this paragraph is very useful in the MarkDown note version using CTRL+click, assuming that one is using VSCode with the **Foam** extension ... one thing is clear [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) ***is kind of [a big deal in the realm of PKM](/2.Areas/00PKMSystems.md) and WILL IMPROVE IMMENSELY WITH USE***.
