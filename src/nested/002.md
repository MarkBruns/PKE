## **Phase I: Foundations and Environment Setup (Days 1-20)**

This initial phase is dedicated to constructing a robust "mission control" for the entire 100-day project. The first week focuses on creating the digital skeleton of the project. Modules 001 and 002 are about the GitHub Repository and Project Initialization.

To accelerate the setup of the PKM's structure on Day 2, the project will be bootstrapped using the Foam VS Code extension ... which uses the mdBook project structures on Day 1 [Phase I](/1.md), which featured a new public GitHub repository created at [https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM). In addition to mdBook, this repository will house the entire Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, including Foam atomic notes in Markdown ... as well as the automation scripts, configuration files ... as well as Foam and mdBook source.
