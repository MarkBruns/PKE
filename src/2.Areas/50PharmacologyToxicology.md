# **Pharmacology and Toxicology**  

[Pharmacology and Toxicology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/pharmacology-and-toxicology) investigate drug actions, mechanisms, and safety, including absorption, distribution, and effects on biological systems. Pharmacology focuses on therapeutic uses, while toxicology assesses harmful exposures and risk assessment. Together, they guide drug development, regulatory approvals, and environmental health protections.
