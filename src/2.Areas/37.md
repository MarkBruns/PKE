Clinical Trials involve systematic studies to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of medical interventions in human participants. These trials progress through phases, from initial safety assessments to large-scale efficacy testing and post-market surveillance. They provide evidence-based data for regulatory approvals and guide clinical practice in treating diseases.

The Clinical Trials subject category is now closed to new submissions following the completion of bioRxiv's clinical research pilot project and launch of the dedicated health sciences server medRxiv (submit.medrxiv.org). New papers that report results of Clinical Trials must now be submitted to medRxiv.
