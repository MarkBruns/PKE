# **Developmental Biology**  

[Developmental Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/developmental-biology) studies how organisms grow and develop from fertilization to maturity, including pattern formation and organogenesis. It examines genetic, cellular, and environmental factors influencing embryonic development and regeneration. This field contributes to understanding birth defects, stem cell biology, and evolutionary developmental changes.
