# **Molecular Biology**  

[Molecular Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/molecular-biology) delves into the structure and function of macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins in cellular processes. It studies gene expression, replication, and repair using techniques such as PCR and CRISPR. This field underpins biotechnology, drug discovery, and insights into molecular diseases.
