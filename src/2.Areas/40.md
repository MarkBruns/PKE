# PLACEHOLDER **Epidemiology**

Epidemiology tracks the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations. It uses statistical methods to identify risk factors, outbreaks, and preventive measures for public health issues. This field supports policy-making, vaccine development, and interventions to control infectious and chronic diseases.

The Epidemiology subject category is now closed to new submissions following the completion of bioRxiv's clinical research pilot project and launch of the dedicated health sciences server medRxiv (submit.medrxiv.org). Most new Epidemiology papers will therefore be found on medRxiv; however, some epidemiology papers that do not include health-related information may be found in other bioRxiv subject categories (e.g., Genetics or Microbiology).
