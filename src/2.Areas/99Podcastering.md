99 Podcastering and Outreach

The POINT of podcastering for us is STRICTLY outreach to authors and researchers ... we sort of don't care about listeners, ie we don't mind if people listen, but the POINT of the podcast is strictly about OUTREACH ... thus about the *conversation*, **we do not do podcasts as entertainment for spectators.**

Intersects with intelligence gathering on pre-prints, and domain-specific knowledge curation primarily because the intent of the podcast is not exactly to grow an audience OF SPECTATORS, but RATHER to develop connections with people who produce knowledge in a specific domain.

Podcasts offer accessible formats for staying updated on important topics and exploring advanced concepts ... not like JRE, or the super popular podcasts that cater to spectators, but material that is more specifically tailored to one's personal knowledge interests ... the intent of podcastering in this fashion is definitely NOT about entertaining or informing an audience -- it's NOT about a professional performance ... rather the intention is about a CONVERSATION between equals.

We look at DOMAIN EXPERTS:

* [Podnews.net](https://podnews.net/archive): Daily podcast industry newsletter/archive curated by James Cridland is a unique opportunity to contextualise the international podcast landscape.

* Lex Fridman's Podcast is somewhat like JRE's or Tim Ferriss, in that it features in-depth interviews with prominent figures in science and technology, including deep dives into topics like AI ... the DIFFERENCE is that Lex, himself is a serious domain expert himself in the realm of AI -- in other words, his podcast is like JRE's podcast USED TO BE, ie focused on martial artists and comedians who were very much like Rogan in that that Rogan was a serious martial artist and comedian ... UNTIL he became like Johnny Carson as a venue for people selling books or movies or candidacies.

* Hidden Brain: Explores the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior, shedding light on psychology and advanced thinking.

* Acquired or TBPN: Actual VC or angel investors aspiring to find the highest growth tech startups ... focus on the stories behind great companies and their high-stakes acquisitions, providing insight into technological and business strategy.
