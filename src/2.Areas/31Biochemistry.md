# **Biochemistry**  

[Biochemistry](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/biochemistry) investigates the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms, including enzymes, metabolites, and biomolecular interactions. It bridges biology and chemistry to explain life at the molecular level, such as protein folding, DNA replication, and metabolic pathways. Advances in this area contribute to drug development, biotechnology, and understanding diseases caused by biochemical imbalances.
