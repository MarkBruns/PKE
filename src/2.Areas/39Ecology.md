# **Ecology**  

[Ecology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/ecology) investigates interactions between organisms and their environments, including population dynamics, community structures, and ecosystem functions. It addresses topics like biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and responses to climate change using field studies and modeling. Research helps inform conservation strategies, resource management, and predictions of ecological impacts.
