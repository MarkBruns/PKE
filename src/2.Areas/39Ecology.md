# **Ecology**  

[Ecology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/ecology) investigates interactions between organisms and their environments, including population dynamics, community structures, and ecosystem functions. It addresses topics like biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and responses to climate change using field studies and modeling. Research helps inform conservation strategies, resource management, and predictions of ecological impacts.

A big part of our interest in ecological systems is the larger, more significant, EMERGENT behaviors that arise out of an ecological system, eg we can't help noticing that human life is based on being a bioreactor for the ecological system of the gut.
