# **Genomics**  

[Genomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/genomics) analyzes entire genomes to understand gene function, organization, and interactions across species. It employs high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to map variations, epigenetics, and comparative genomes. This field drives discoveries in personalized medicine, evolutionary history, and biotechnology innovations.
