# **Bioinformatics**  

[Bioinformatics](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/bioinformatics) develops computational tools and algorithms to analyze large-scale biological data, such as genomic sequences and protein structures. It combines computer science, statistics, and biology to interpret complex datasets from experiments like next-generation sequencing. Applications include gene prediction, evolutionary studies, and personalized medicine through data mining and modeling.
