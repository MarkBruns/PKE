# **Microbiology**  

[Microbiology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/microbiology) investigates microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea, including their physiology, genetics, and ecology. It explores microbial roles in health, disease, environments, and biotechnology through culturing and sequencing techniques. Applications include antibiotic development, bioremediation, and understanding microbiomes.
