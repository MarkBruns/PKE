# Workspace Janitor (stub)

**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.** 

If you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).

## Notes

Implement background janitor that ensures all files are correctly linked and updated using the [VS Code Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks), exposing it from foam-vscode with a [TaskProvider](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/task-provider)
