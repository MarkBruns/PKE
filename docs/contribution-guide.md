Foam is open to contributions of any kind, including but not limited to code, documentation, ideas and feedback. Here's how to get started on contributing to Foam:

- Use Foam for yourself, figure out what could be improved.
- Check out [[roadmap]] to see what's already in the plans. I have thoughts about how to implement some of these, but open to ideas and code contributions!
- Read about our [[principles]] to understand Foam's philosophy and direction
- Read and act in accordance of our [[code-of-conduct]].
- Feel free to open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to give me feedback and ideas for new features.
