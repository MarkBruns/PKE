# Terminology

It would be good to have some shared terminology to talk about Foam concepts. Some in-group terminology is acceptable, but we shouldn't be obtuse just to be exclusive.

Here's some ideas, these are open for discussion.

## Foam (project)

The set of tools and ideas collected in this organisation.

## Foam workspace

The directory/repository where you keep all your documents.

## Bubble

Individual Foam document, written in Markdown.

## Foam blog

When you use Foam to publish content to an audience.

_Better ideas welcome._
