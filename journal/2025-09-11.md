#### **Modules 3-5: Mission Control with GitHub Projects**

To effectively manage a 100-day endeavor, this entire plan will be translated into a functional project board [using GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects). The GitHub Project-Driven or Issue-Driven approach makes the project plan itself a dynamic, version-controlled artifact ... but of course there are lots of alternatives to Github's approach -- it's just that anyone using this GitHub repository will necessarily have access to all of the project management and issue management functionality that GitHub features provide without cost for anyone. If a team has resources to use different Project- or Issue-driven development application, then all of the people on that team should become familiar with with the team's chosen approach. In other words, it's ALL about really ***using*** what the team is using -- we can assume for GitHub users from distributed organizations and geographies, the GitHub approach will be best approach, albeit the lowest common denominator approach, for the distributed team. Fortunately, the GitHub functionality is not bad at all and even maybe hard to beat.

During these three days, a new GitHub Project will be created for [Phase I](https://github.com/orgs/AncientGuy/projects/1/views/4), [Phase II](https://github.com/orgs/AncientGuy/projects/2/views/4), [Phase III](https://github.com/orgs/AncientGuy/projects/3/views/4) and [Phase IV](https://github.com/orgs/AncientGuy/projects/4/views/4). An issue will then be opened for each of the 100 modules. These issues will be organized into phases and categorized using custom fields to track status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), module type (e.g., Setup, Rust, Python, Exploration), and estimated complexity. This immediate application of GitHub Projects transforms project management from a peripheral task into a core component of the learning experience.
