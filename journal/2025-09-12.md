#### **Modules 3-5: Mission Control with GitHub Projects**

To effectively manage a 100-day endeavor, this entire plan will be translated into a functional project board [using GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects). 


Experimentation and rapid learning illustrate the importance of failure and structuring experiments to offer differences, some failures, some successes but with multiple different approaches comprised of different factor levels.

Thus the experimental structure should try different approaches that almost work, but don't quite work yet, perhaps with factors chosen per orthongal arrays or other experimental designs; it's the difference in how well the different factors and interaction point to something working that helps us to learn faster.

The 40 principles and contradiction matrix of TRIZ help manage the cognitive load of trying different things to get past constraints.
