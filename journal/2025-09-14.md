Before automating the deployment process, it is **crucial** to understand the underlying mechanics that enable the automation ... *we don't want to automate a clusterfuck, just because compute is cheap -- because all that does is increase the output of NOISE*... much of what we will ask our PKM to do will involve automation of tedious tasks in the [diverse areas of rapidly developing knowledge that we will want to agentically explore in the future](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/src/2.Areas). Each sub-area will require different highly customized AGENTS.md files to direct the AI agent as well as standardized [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) or [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) servers to ensure that the system only pulls from valid data sources and does that in a manner that produces predictably usable results. We will generally use both the A2A protocol and MCP (Model Context Protocol) in conjunction, rather than choosing one over the other. MCP is for an agent to connect to tools and data, while A2A is for agents in multi-agent systems to coordinate and collaborate with each other. For complex systems, an agent uses A2A to work with other agents and then uses MCP to access the specific tools and data needed to complete its part of the task. 

Automating agentic workflows is the kind of things that used to require vast, vast, vast teams of highly qualified middleware software devs ... pulling data from myriad sources ... whether it was engineering CAD data OR current airline logistics data OR GIS geospatial data ... used to be far beyond the reach of any individual doing research or engaged in development engineering. But that's really changed and will continue changing, so that individuals will be able to weild the power of monstrous amounts of compute ... whereas most of the distributed compute that we once found in smartphones, laptops and workstations was largely used to track users, browser histories and to anticipate things like Netflix movie demands. The ability of individuals to actually wield compute in order to squeeze more information from deeper analysis of more complex data will soon be the kind of skills that separates the *haves* from the *have nots.*

This module, while being of lower ***immediate*** priority *since our mdBook repo just works for right now* ... but we want to focus on the much more essential, longer-term, much larger matter of being familiar with the automation that people take for granted -- this goes beyond managing workflows and runs without leaving your editor or IDE; it's also about keeping track of your CI builds and deployments, including more advanced agentic AI systems -- if we use things like [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) or [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) servers, we will absolutely need to rely on automation and machines to help us investigate failures and view logs, to be able to have an inkling of how good/bad the information is that our knowledge system is providing us.

Specifically, at this early point of our process, now that we have mapped out the next 100 days of where this PKM thing is going to take us, we want to delve into the simplest thing that we have currently working.  We want to examine the deployment of mdBook to GitHub Pages with a finer tooth comb, to [begin to understand how to use GitHub Actions workflows to automate tasks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows) including the [GH Actions Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions) to help us more efficiently, rapidly [learn or re-learn somethings about YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/yaml/) which is a superset of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Eventually, we might even want to follow along with those [contributing](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the [GitHub Actions VS Code Extension](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/9557) or, since Actions and automation is so critical, we might be interested in the larger [public roadmap of GitHub product development features](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247).

At first we might just to explore the [.github/workflows/mdbook.yml](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/.github/workflows/mdbook.yml) YAML file with the [GH Actions Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions) ...  and ***READ*** lots of the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) ... but at some point, we will probably need to test our knowledge by ***breaking*** our mdbook.yml page in different ways and test it in different ways with [an online YAML linter](https://www.yamllint.com/) or study  to have a better inkling of understanding for potential future troubleshooting of issues that cause a breakage -- for example, we might notice certain things that could go awry in the future.

Changes that we do not control will happen -- it's likely that there be some change in GitHub mgmt's vision of what features GitHub should offer. Also, we might want to make "minor changes" to things that we control. For example, maybe we decide that the repository settings should be configured to deploy from a specific branch; many monorepos that have many different things going on will use a clearly-labeled branch named something like gh-pages. We typically run the 'mdbook serve --open' build command run locally to generate the static site in the book/book directory; the contents of this local output directory could be manually committed and pushed to separate gh-pages branch. *But even little changes are not often trivial or inconsequential ...we should expect that changes will happen, affecting things that nobody foresaw.*

Of course, changes are not necessarily bad -- but often necessary, massively-positive long overdue change produces unintended consequences, especially in things that are not used by many ... but the push for CHANGE happens, because that change is needed for a larger advance. For example, at this time GitHub is not able to support the GH Actions extension with remote repositories (including github.dev and vscode.dev), because enough people are not demanding this ... but failure to support remote repositories confines the use of GH Actions locally downloaded GitHub repositories that get synched with GitHub's central repositories. But we can expect updates on something like this in the future and when that happens, it's ***almost*** certain that some functionality that now just works will not work flawlessly when that major feature of working with remote repositories is added.

*We should expect that BIG changes in knowledge engineering technology will happen ... AND WITH GREATER FREQUENCY, ie because it will be expected that devs using agentic workflows will be able to overcome hurdles that in the past have ensured backward compatibility, ie as a result of AI-assisted IDEs we should expect that backward compatibility will be less of a concern.* ***We should foresee a day where it is expected that users of technology not be as helpless or unable to use AI-assistance, ie it's like expecting a trucker should be able to figure out how use a sophisticated navigation system that trucking company and all of its drivers must depend upon.*** 

This exercise provides the basis of a more complete understanding of the build artifacts and the deployment mechanism that will be automated in a later phase. We want to do more more than just know [how to build mdBook with Github Actions today](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-mdbook-with-github-actions-eb9899e55d7e) ... because GitHub is always changing, improving things -- making things safer, so our current knowledge might be deprecated by some future change... we have used the cookbook template to publish our mdBook to GitHub pages and, as we might expect, this approach has been fool-proofed enough by GH over the years that the GH template approach tends to just work ... ***for NOW!*** Instead of just being grateful that it works *somehow*, not asking any questions and moving on to other things we'll only superficially understand, we really NEED to spend a wee bit of time developing a much deeper understanding of the process and pains of automation, so we will start going over some suggested blog postings like [the Beginner's Guide To Python Automation Scripts (With Code)](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/python-automation-scripts-beginners-guide/) or [19 Super-Useful Python Scripts to Automate Your Daily Tasks](https://www.index.dev/blog/python-automation-scripts).

We will want to go back and spend some more time with [the DETAILS in mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that we may have glanced over, especially in the realm of [renderers](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html) and [mdBook's approach to Continuous Integration](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html) with something like GitHub, before [trying to create our first CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions](https://brandonkindred.medium.com/creating-your-first-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-81c668008582) or exploring [different ways that people have used GitHub Actions to deploy static sites](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), specifically [step by step instructions for overcoming problems publishing an mdBook on gh-pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1803).
