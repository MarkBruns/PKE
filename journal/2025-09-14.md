Before automating the deployment process, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanics. This module involves a manual deployment of the nascent mdBook to GitHub Pages. The repository settings will be configured to deploy from a specific branch, typically gh-pages. The mdbook build command will be run locally to generate the static site in the book/book directory. The contents of this output directory will then be manually committed and pushed to the gh-pages branch. This exercise provides a clear baseline understanding of the build artifacts and the deployment mechanism that will be automated in a later phase.

We will want to spend some time with the [mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) especially in the realm of [renderers](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html) and [mdBook's approach to Continuous Integration](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html) with something like GitHub, before [creating our first CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions](https://brandonkindred.medium.com/creating-your-first-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-81c668008582) or exploring [different ways that people have used GitHub Actions to deploy static sites](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), specifically [step by step instructions for overcoming problems publishing an mdBook on gh-pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1803). 

This is about more than just [how to build mdBook with Github Actions](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-mdbook-with-github-actions-eb9899e55d7e). Instead of just being happy that it works and not asking any questions, we really want to start developing a much deeper understanding of the process and pains of automation, so we will start going over the [Beginner's Guide To Python Automation Scripts (With Code)](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/python-automation-scripts-beginners-guide/) and things like [19 Super-Useful Python Scripts to Automate Your Daily Tasks](https://www.index.dev/blog/python-automation-scripts).
