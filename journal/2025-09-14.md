Before automating the deployment process, it is **crucial** to understand the underlying mechanics that enable the automation ... *we don't want to automate a clusterfuck, just because compute is cheap -- because all that does is increase the output of NOISE*... much of what we will ask our PKM to do will involve automation of tedious tasks in the [diverse areas of rapidly developing knowledge that we will want to agentically explore in the future](/src/2.Areas/). Each sub-area will require different highly customized AGENTS.md files to direct the AI agent as well as standardized [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) or [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) servers to ensure that the system only pulls from valid data sources and does that in a manner that produces predictably usable results, ie the goal of this kind of PKM dev work is to get results that demonstrate a performance of the more *deeply* intelligent, context-aware system that is far more expediditous, more dependable and produces higher-quality results with lower costs than any existing systems.

This module focuses on ***just*** the automation of deployment of mdBook to GitHub Pages. The repository settings will be configured to deploy from a specific branch; many monorepos that have many different things going on will use a clearly-labeled branch named something like gh-pages. We typically run the 'mdbook serve --open' build command run locally to generate the static site in the book/book directory. The contents of this output directory could be manually committed and pushed to separate gh-pages branch. This exercise provides a clear baseline understanding of the build artifacts and the deployment mechanism that will be automated in a later phase.

In other words, this Module is about more than just [how to build mdBook with Github Actions](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-mdbook-with-github-actions-eb9899e55d7e) ... we have used the cookbook method to publish our mdBook to GitHub pages and it's been fool-proofed enough by GH over the years that it tends to just work. Instead of just being happy that it works, not asking any questions and moving on to other things we'll only superficially understand, we really want to spend a wee bit of time developing a much deeper understanding of the process and pains of automation, so we will start going over suggested blog postings like [the Beginner's Guide To Python Automation Scripts (With Code)](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/python-automation-scripts-beginners-guide/) or [19 Super-Useful Python Scripts to Automate Your Daily Tasks](https://www.index.dev/blog/python-automation-scripts). 

We will want to go back and spend some more time with [the DETAILS in mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that we may have glanced over, especially in the realm of [renderers](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html) and [mdBook's approach to Continuous Integration](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html) with something like GitHub, before [trying to create our first CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions](https://brandonkindred.medium.com/creating-your-first-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-81c668008582) or exploring [different ways that people have used GitHub Actions to deploy static sites](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), specifically [step by step instructions for overcoming problems publishing an mdBook on gh-pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1803).
