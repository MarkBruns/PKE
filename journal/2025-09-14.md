Before automating the deployment process, it is **crucial** to understand the underlying mechanics that enable the automation ... *we don't want to automate a clusterfuck, just because compute is cheap -- because all that does is increase the output of NOISE*... much of what we will ask our PKM to do will involve automation of tedious tasks in the [diverse areas of rapidly developing knowledge that we will want to agentically explore in the future](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/src/2.Areas). Each sub-area will require different highly customized AGENTS.md files to direct the AI agent as well as standardized [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) or [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) servers to ensure that the system only pulls from valid data sources and does that in a manner that produces predictably usable results. We will generally use both the A2A protocol and MCP (Model Context Protocol) in conjunction, rather than choosing one over the other. MCP is for an agent to connect to tools and data, while A2A is for agents in multi-agent systems to coordinate and collaborate with each other. For complex systems, an agent uses A2A to work with other agents and then uses MCP to access the specific tools and data needed to complete its part of the task.

This module, while being of lower ***immediate*** priority *since our mdBook repo just works for right now* ... but we want to focus on the much more essential, longer-term, much larger matter of being familiar with the automation that people take for granted -- this goes beyond managing workflows and runs without leaving your editor or IDE; it's also about keeping track of your CI builds and deployments, including more advanced agentic AI systems -- if we use things like [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) or [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) servers, we will absolutely need to rely on automation and machines to help us investigate failures and view logs, to be able to have an inkling of how good/bad the information is that our knowledge system is providing us.

Specifically, at this early point of our process, now that we have mapped out the next 100 days of where this PKM thing is going to take us, we want to delve into the simplest thing that we have currently working.  We want to examine the deployment of mdBook to GitHub Pages with a finer tooth comb, to [begin to understand how to use GitHub Actions workflows to automate tasks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows) including the [GH Actions Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions) and even to [learn or re-learn somethings about YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/yaml/) which is a superset of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Eventually, we might even want to follow along with those contributing to the [GitHub Actions VS Code Extension](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/9557) or, since Actions and automation is so critical, we might be interested in the larger [public roadmap of GitHub product development features](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247).

At first we might just to explore and ***READ***, but at some point, we will probably need to test our knowledge by ***breaking*** our mdbook.yml page in different ways and test it with [an online YAML linter](https://www.yamllint.com/) or study the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to have a better inkling of understanding for potential future troubleshooting of issues that cause a breakage -- for example, by examining the [.github/workflows/mdbook.yml](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/.github/workflows/mdbook.yml), we might notice certain things that could go awry in the future, eg of course, we can see that MDBOOK_VERSION: 0.4.36 works fine with current version of Ubuntu-latest, but it is concievable that a future version of mdBook might not work well with the latest version of Ubuntu, ie a change in mgmt's vision of what features GitHub should offer. We might want to change things on OUR side -- perhaps, the repository settings should be configured to deploy from a specific branch; many monorepos that have many different things going on will use a clearly-labeled branch named something like gh-pages. We typically run the 'mdbook serve --open' build command run locally to generate the static site in the book/book directory. The contents of this output directory could be manually committed and pushed to separate gh-pages branch. *Little changes are not often trivial or inconsequential ...we should expect that changes will happen.*

This exercise provides the basis of a more complete understanding of the build artifacts and the deployment mechanism that will be automated in a later phase. We want to do more more than just know [how to build mdBook with Github Actions today](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-mdbook-with-github-actions-eb9899e55d7e) ... because GitHub is always changing, improving things -- making things safer, so our current knowledge might be deprecated by some future change... we have used the cookbook template to publish our mdBook to GitHub pages and, as we might expect, this approach has been fool-proofed enough by GH over the years that the GH template approach tends to just work ... ***for NOW!*** Instead of just being grateful that it works *somehow*, not asking any questions and moving on to other things we'll only superficially understand, we really NEED to spend a wee bit of time developing a much deeper understanding of the process and pains of automation, so we will start going over some suggested blog postings like [the Beginner's Guide To Python Automation Scripts (With Code)](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/python-automation-scripts-beginners-guide/) or [19 Super-Useful Python Scripts to Automate Your Daily Tasks](https://www.index.dev/blog/python-automation-scripts).

We will want to go back and spend some more time with [the DETAILS in mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that we may have glanced over, especially in the realm of [renderers](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html) and [mdBook's approach to Continuous Integration](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html) with something like GitHub, before [trying to create our first CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions](https://brandonkindred.medium.com/creating-your-first-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-81c668008582) or exploring [different ways that people have used GitHub Actions to deploy static sites](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), specifically [step by step instructions for overcoming problems publishing an mdBook on gh-pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1803).
