## **Phase I: Foundations and Environment Setup (Days 1-20)**

Phase I is dedicated to constructing a robust "mission control" for the entire 100-day project. The first week focuses on creating the digital skeleton of the project. Modules 001 and 002 are about the GitHub Repository and Project Initialization.

To accelerate the setup of the PKM's note-taking structure on Day 2, the project will incorporate [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), as we use the Foam VS Code extension and add basic starter templates. The [**Foam** development Foam community [on Discord]](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g) is all about rapid development of this personal knowledge management and sharing system, originally inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built as an extension of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that utilizes [GitHub](https://github.com/) features. Our implementation of **Foam** is very lightweight and thus will reside within this PKM repository which also stores the mdBook markdown files; thus, PKM's **Foam** will be used as an editing tool for meta-organizing our research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, eventually, publishing the content to the web utilizing the [https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM mdBook project structure](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM) we set up on Day 1 of [Phase I](/1.md).

> we will probably want to delete these instructions as you customize your template, but they're temporarily here, just to illustrate what **Foam** generates as a starter template.

Welcome to your new daily note template.
The file is located in `.foam/templates/daily-note.md`.
The text in this file will be used as the content of your daily note.
You can customize it as you like, and you can use the following variables in the template:
- `2025`: The year of the date
- `09`: The month of the date
- `10`: The day of the date
- `2025-09-10`: The title of the note
