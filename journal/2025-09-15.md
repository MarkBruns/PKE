The GENERAL gist of this is to automate intelligence gathering to have SIGNIFICANTLY denser material to ***READ*** ... or to drill down into in a knowledge engineering dashboard, ie what mdBook will need to become.

*Of course, since AI capabiliities are growing rapidly, it's likely that we will be able to listen to this material, having it ***read*** to us while we rest, but whatever ***reading*** means in the future is just a digression into style and formatting ...* the whole point is delivering SIGNIFICANTLY denser intelligence gathered and presented in some usable fashion.

Ultimately, the larger process is about engineering knowledge as we engineer construction materials or tooling and equipment for a mfg process -- it's about breaking down the BIG PROJECT, into smaller Big Projects, which are each broken down into Major Phases, which are broken down into the work of daily modules. OUR goal in this 100-day curriculum, as grandiose as it might sound, is to develop an understanding of what the process will be to create the beginnings of multi-agent personal knowledge engineering system ... to build our knowledge in these 100 days to have the knowledge to develop the plan we will need to use in building the next 100-day set of Phases.

Though our mdBook serves current rather modest needs for reading material, ie it's a relatively easy matter to [develop a P.A.R.A. notetaking structure for the Project, Areas, Resources, Archives that best reflect one's main interests](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_d7ce5345-5f3c-4a7c-a5fc-72a0ab66870c), although the first recommendation will generally be to keep the scope to 10 Areas, as we did with the beginning part of this endeavor June 1-Sept 8 ... but at some point, expanding to [100 Areas](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/src/2.Areas) helps to illustrate the value of greater automation in producing denser, summarized synopses of reading material.

Thus, the strategic objective in this set of five Phases involves building the scaffolding of a robust automation infrastructure ASAP ... before agent-augmented analysis becomes table stakes for professional competence or even being able to participate in the discussion in any knowledge-intensive field, although we can certainly see that is certainly already happening to strong enough degree. 

Specifically, for where we're at today on Day 7 of these early Modules, in this early point of Phase I of our 100-day process, we know enough to be scared or intimidated, if not overwhelemed ...  we have mapped out where this PKM thing is going to take us, we want to delve into the simplest thing that we have currently working.  

Right now, we want to comb through the deployment of mdBook to GitHub Pages with a much finer tooth comb, to [begin to really understand how to use and adapt GitHub Actions workflows to automate tasks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows) including use of the [GH Actions Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions) to help us more efficiently, rapidly [learn or re-learn somethings about YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/yaml/) which is a superset of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Eventually, we might even want to follow along with those [contributing](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the [GitHub Actions VS Code Extension](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/9557) or, since [GitHub Actions and automation of GitHub workflows](https://github.com/actions) is so critical, we might be interested in the larger [public roadmap of GitHub product development features](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247).

At first we might just to explore the [.github/workflows/mdbook.yml](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/.github/workflows/mdbook.yml) YAML file with the [GH Actions Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions) ...  and ***READ*** lots of the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) ... but at some point, we will probably need to test our knowledge by ***breaking*** our mdbook.yml page in different ways and test it in different ways with [an online YAML linter](https://www.yamllint.com/) or study  to have a better inkling of understanding for potential future troubleshooting of issues that cause a breakage -- for example, we might notice certain things that could go awry in the future.

Changes that we do not control will happen -- it's likely that there be some change in GitHub mgmt's vision of what features GitHub should offer. Also, we might want to make "minor changes" to things that we control. For example, maybe we decide that the repository settings should be configured to deploy from a specific branch; many monorepos that have many different things going on will use a clearly-labeled branch named something like gh-pages. We typically run the 'mdbook serve --open' build command run locally to generate the static site in the book/book directory; the contents of this local output directory could be manually committed and pushed to separate gh-pages branch. *But even little changes are not often trivial or inconsequential ...we should expect that changes will happen, affecting things that nobody foresaw.*

Of course, changes are not necessarily bad -- but often necessary, massively-positive long overdue change produces unintended consequences, especially in things that are not used by many ... but the push for CHANGE happens, because that change is needed for a larger advance. For example, at this time GitHub is not able to support the GH Actions extension with remote repositories (including github.dev and vscode.dev), because enough people are not demanding this ... but failure to support remote repositories confines the use of GH Actions locally downloaded GitHub repositories that get synched with GitHub's central repositories. But we can expect updates on something like this in the future and when that happens, it's ***almost*** certain that some functionality that now just works will not work flawlessly when that major feature of working with remote repositories is added.

*We should expect that BIG changes in knowledge engineering technology will happen ... AND WITH GREATER FREQUENCY, ie because it will be expected that devs using agentic workflows will be able to overcome hurdles that in the past have ensured backward compatibility, ie as a result of AI-assisted IDEs we should expect that backward compatibility will be less of a concern.* ***We should foresee a day where it is expected that users of technology not be as helpless or unable to use AI-assistance, ie it's like expecting a trucker should be able to figure out how use a sophisticated navigation system that trucking company and all of its drivers must depend upon.*** 

This exercise provides the basis of a more complete understanding of the build artifacts and the deployment mechanism that will be automated in a later phase. We want to do more more than just know [how to build mdBook with Github Actions today](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-mdbook-with-github-actions-eb9899e55d7e) ... because GitHub is always changing, improving things -- making things safer, so our current knowledge might be deprecated by some future change... we have used the cookbook template to publish our mdBook to GitHub pages and, as we might expect, this approach has been fool-proofed enough by GH over the years that the GH template approach tends to just work ... ***for NOW!*** Instead of just being grateful that it works *somehow*, not asking any questions and moving on to other things we'll only superficially understand, we really NEED to spend a wee bit of time developing a much deeper understanding of the process and pains of automation, so we will start going over some suggested blog postings like [the Beginner's Guide To Python Automation Scripts (With Code)](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/python-automation-scripts-beginners-guide/) or [19 Super-Useful Python Scripts to Automate Your Daily Tasks](https://www.index.dev/blog/python-automation-scripts).

We will want to go back and spend some more time with [the DETAILS in mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that we may have glanced over, especially in the realm of [renderers](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html) and [mdBook's approach to Continuous Integration](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html) with something like GitHub, before [trying to create our first CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions](https://brandonkindred.medium.com/creating-your-first-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-81c668008582) or exploring [different ways that people have used GitHub Actions to deploy static sites](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), specifically [step by step instructions for overcoming problems publishing an mdBook on gh-pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1803).
