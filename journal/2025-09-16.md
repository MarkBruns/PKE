With the mdBook P.A.R.A. project structure largely in place, the second week is dedicated to installing, configuring, and establishing a working ***relationship*** with the [core open source agentic assistant, Cline](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/what-is-cline), but we will be evaluating/following the progress of the [multi-branch version control client, GitButler](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler) powered by Tauri/Rust/Svelte. Both Cline and GitButler are probably best equipped by their designers to be used with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) or [Antropic's Claude Sonnet 4 LLM model](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4), but we will try these with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/overview/principles) in order to evaluate different LLM models.

The primary tool for this project, the [Cline VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev), will be installed directly from inside VS Code Extensions marketplace. Configuration is the next critical step. An API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/overview/principles) will be generated and added to the Cline settings. OpenRouter serves as a powerful API gateway, providing access to a multitude of LLMs from various providers like Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. Initial experiments will be conducted using different models ... first using the powerful [Claude Sonnet 4 LLM model](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4), especially for complex tasks, and then maybe various free-tier models, to gain an intuitive understanding of the cost-performance trade-offs inherent in different models.
